Gehwah is a Bootstrap helper. It makes a developer's life easier by extracting specific Bootstrap css styles from Bootstrap css files. Gehwah recognizes the following folders to search for bootstrap files:
	* ./
	* ./css/
	* ./public/css/
If above folders are not existing, then http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/ will be used to get bootstrap css files.

By default, Gehwah saves the results in ./bootstrap.gehwah.css, ./bootstrap-theme.gehwah.css.

Usage of Gehwah is:

gehwah.php -c|-class [class name] [-option value]

-c [class name] is required for Gehwah to start, for example gehwah.php -c .navbar-inverse is to show all css styles defined for .navbar-inverse. In example/modified navbar-inverse/, there is modified .navbar-inverse, namely .navbar-gehwah which has the same styling effects as .navbar-inverse, but different color.

[-option value] is optional. For example,
-e abc is to save the found css styles into files with '.abc.' replacing '.min.' in bootstrap css files, including bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap-theme.min.css.
