Here I am dealing with html class names. In css files, a class name start with '.' ( except file extensions in url(), or object properties). In html files, a class can be found in "class='classname'".

=============
Part I - gehwah.php
[test available at www.loudpicks.com/gehwah.php?class=.navbar-inverse ]

Gehwah is a Bootstrap helper. It makes a developer's life easier by extracting specific Bootstrap css styles from Bootstrap css files. Gehwah recognizes the following folders to search for bootstrap files:
	* ./
	* ./css/
	* ./public/css/
If above folders are not existing, then http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/ will be used to get bootstrap css files.

By default, Gehwah saves the results in ./bootstrap.gehwah.css, ./bootstrap-theme.gehwah.css. 

Gehwah accepts GET and POST requests from www.gehwah.com (coming soon) where $_REQUEST['class'] must be given.

It also can be run as command lines. Usage of Gehwah in command line is:

gehwah.php -c|-class [class name] [-option value]

-c [class name] is required for Gehwah to start, for example gehwah.php -c .navbar-inverse is to show all css styles defined for .navbar-inverse. In example/modified navbar-inverse/, there is modified .navbar-inverse, namely .navbar-gehwah which has the same styling effects as .navbar-inverse, but different color.

[-option value] is optional. For example,
-e abc is to save the found css styles into files with '.abc.' replacing '.min.' in bootstrap css files, including bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap-theme.min.css.

==================
Part II - Gehwah.php

CssClasses : get classes from a css string. After loading a css string from bootstrap css files and processing the classes, one should unset .Microsoft,.gradient, .eot, .ttf, .svg, .woff from the classes.

CssTags: get tags from a css string.

HtmlClasses: get classes from a html string and add '.' before each class.

HtmlTags: get tags from a html string.

Bootstrap: get all classes from bootstrap css files.

Gehwah: Gehwah::rmUnusedClasses($classes) remove unused classes from bootstrap files. Used classes are defined in $classes. Unsed classes are defeind in Bootstrap::GetClasses() but not in $classes.

Example. www.loudpicks.com/account/, see loudpicks.account.bootstrap.gehwah.css in <head>. Its size is about 1/8 of all bootstrap files.
