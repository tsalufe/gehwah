=============
Summary

Gehwah package is a Bootstrap cleaner. It has too parts: gehwah.php and Gehwah.php ( my poor namings!). (1) gehwah.php can extract the css styles for a class as an input, runable from command line or with get/post requests. (2) Gehwah.php provides the classes, especially Gehwah, needed to process html file/string or class arrays and minize the size of bootstrap files to the classes used.
 
In this package, 'class' is used everywhere. It could mean an php class or an html class. But here mostly it means a html class. In css files, a class name start with '.' ( except file extensions in url(), or object properties). In html files, a class can be found in "class='classname'".

============
To find all styles about a class in bootstrap
./run.php -c .navbar
or
goto www.gehwah.com/run/class/.navbar

============
To minimize the size of the bootstrap styles to the need of your website,
./run.php -url 'http://www.loudpicks.com/account'
or
goto www.gehwah.com/run/url/www.loudpicks.com/account
